# Coding Style

This repo uses the [jQuery coding style](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/blob/master/presets/jquery.json) with single quotation marks instead of double quotation marks.

Gulp has already been set up to lint for these coding standards. [See the JSCS Code Style Documentation](http://jscs.info/overview) for more information on
JavaScript coding standards.
